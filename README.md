Lightweight java enterprise backend for your html5 applications

The meaning of lightweigth
-------------
Usually the Java EE projects are started as a "template" of several different technologies including: Spring, Hibernate, Java EE, Logging frameworks, MV* frameworks, Templating frameworks and so one.

This templates have their roots in history and tradition, but more or less totally unnecessary and even worse, time and money consumers.

With following samples I want to show, how to write plain Java EE code, that in most complicated cases uses only a Hibernate ORM framework and logging framework log4j. 

None the less, it features asynchronous calls, delayed job execution, multithreading and so one.

Thats it.
